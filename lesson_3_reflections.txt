When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Using a remote respository would probably make a lot of sense if you're working with a group of people or
if you're going to be working from different computers.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

There might be some changes that you don't want locally that someone else has added.
