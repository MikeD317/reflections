When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Using a remote respository would probably make a lot of sense if you're working with a group of people or
if you're going to be working from different computers.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

There might be some changes that you don't want locally that someone else has added.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

You fork a repository on GitHub when you want a copy of someone's repository that you can make changes to.  A clone is a local copy of a repository on GitHub.  Branches are offshoots of a repository.
